Resource Based (Adaptive) load balancing  Introduction:  For network services to be highly available and reliable, load balancing is  essential. It is essential to evenly divide network traffic over several  servers in order to accommodate the rising demand and maintain a  consistent user experience as a result of the increase in internet usage.  One technique for balancing network traffic among several servers is the  Source IP Hash load balancing approach.It is also used to prevent any  single resource from becoming a bottleneck, which can result in  decreased performance and increased latency.  Types of load balancers:  There are two main types of load balancers: static and adaptive.  Regardless of the resources' availability or usage, a static load balancer  uniformly distributes requests across all of them. On the other hand, an  adaptive load balancer decides how to distribute incoming requests after  considering the availability and usage of each resource. An example of an  adaptive load balancer is resource-based (or adaptive) load balancing.  Resource based load balancing:(Adaptive load balancing)  It is a method for evenly distributing workloads in distributed systems. It  operates by evenly dividing the workload among all system nodes  according to the resources available. This method assures that no node is  overcrowded, which is advantageous for applications that demand a lot of  resources. Maximizing resource use and reducing request response  times are the two objectives of resource-based load balancing.  Methodology:  By creating a hash value from the source IP address of incoming network  packets, the Source IP Hash load balancing technique operates. The  server to which the packets should be sent is then determined using the  hash value. The client will have a consistent experience thanks to this  technique, which makes sure that all packets from the same source IP  address are routed to the same server. Without requiring complicated  algorithms or configurations, the Source IP Hash technique offers a quick  and efficient solution to guarantee that network traffic is split equitably  among servers.
Implementation:  1. Monitoring: The first step is to monitor the performance and  resource usage of each server in the network. This can be  achieved using various monitoring tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, or  New Relic.  2. Resource allocation: Once the performance and resource usage of  each server are known, the next step is to allocate resources to  each server based on their performance and resource utilization.  This involves dynamically adjusting the resources allocated to each  server based on the workload and resource utilization at any given  time.  3. Load balancing: Once the resources have been allocated to each  server, the next step is to distribute the workload across the servers  in a way that maximizes resource utilization and minimizes the risk  of server overloading. This involves dynamically adjusting the  workload distribution based on the performance and resource  utilization of each server.  Advantages:  ●   Consistent user experience:The Source IP Hash load balancing  approach ensures a consistent user experience by sending all  packets from the same source IP address to the same server. This  helps to provide a great user experience by preventing sessions  from being interrupted when traffic is switched between servers.  ●   Scalability:The Source IP Hash load balancing technique is  scalable, permitting an increase in the number of servers without  degrading the load balancing's efficiency. This is crucial in settings  where the user population is quickly growing since it enables the  addition of new users servers to accommodate the growing  demand  ●   Fair distribution of traffic: By ensuring that traffic is evenly dispersed  among servers, the Source IP Hash load balancing mechanism  avoids any one server from becoming overloaded. This is crucial  for reducing downtime because an overloaded server can deny  users access to services.  Disadvantage:  ●   Inefficient use of resources: When many source IP addresses point  to the same server, the server may get overloaded, which can  result in an inefficient use of resources. Users may experience  decreased speed and more latency as a result of this.
●   Lack of control: It is challenging to limit traffic spikes when using  the Source IP Hash load balancing method because it offers no  control over the distribution of traffic. Due to this, a single server  may get overloaded during moments of high traffic, denying users  of their services.  Conclusion:  Resource-based (adaptive) load balancing is a useful method for dividing  workload among several servers in a way that maximizes resource  utilization and raises service availability. To guarantee that the strategy is  successful in maximizing resource consumption and enhancing  performance, it must be implemented with rigorous monitoring, resource  allocation, and load balancing.
