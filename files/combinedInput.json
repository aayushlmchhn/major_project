{"text":"IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4, which has been the primary internet protocol since the inception of the internet. IPv6 was designed to address the shortcomings of IPv4, particularly the limited number of available IP addresses. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, which provide an enormous number of unique addresses compared to the 32-bit addresses used in IPv4.\n\nIPv6 has several advantages over IPv4. First, IPv6 addresses provide a larger address space, which can support a virtually unlimited number of devices connected to the internet. Second, IPv6 provides better security features than IPv4, such as mandatory IPsec support. Third, IPv6 offers improved network performance, particularly in routing and packet handling.\n\nOne of the main drivers for the adoption of IPv6 is the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. IPv4 has a theoretical limit of about 4.3 billion addresses, which have almost all been allocated. In contrast, IPv6 has an address space of 2^128, or approximately 3.4 x 10^38, which is more than enough to provide unique addresses for all devices connected to the internet, now and in the future.\n\nDespite the advantages of IPv6, adoption has been slow, particularly among end-users. As of January 2021, only 30% of the top 1000 websites supported IPv6, although this number has been steadily increasing over the past few years. Adoption rates vary widely by region, with some countries, such as Belgium and Switzerland, having much higher adoption rates than others.\n\nOne of the main challenges in the adoption of IPv6 is the need to upgrade existing network infrastructure. This can be particularly challenging for large organizations with complex networks, where the transition to IPv6 can take several years. Another challenge is the need to ensure compatibility with legacy systems, which may not support IPv6.","json":{"no_of_question":5,"allow_answer":true,"question_type":"mcq","validate_question":true}}
